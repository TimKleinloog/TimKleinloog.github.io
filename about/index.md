## This website is mostly about me.

My name is Tim Kleinloog and I live in Eindhoven, Netherlands. I made this website/blog in order to capture and share interesting events and projects in my life.

As a student Industrial Engineering, I developed a keen interest in data science and plan to develop myself as a skillful and creative data analyst.

To get updates on the last developments in my staring career you can look on my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/timkleinloog) page.
